introducing Guardian (v1) - an AI tool that nudges you to stay focused. 

input your task, select the AI's personality, and now you have a Guardian that watches you while you work.

The AI will have context to your activity and will send you a message if it thinks you're distracted. You can make the messages nice, direct, or mean if you want (I recommend mean).
built w/ Swift for macOS.
